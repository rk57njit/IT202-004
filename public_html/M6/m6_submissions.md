<table><tr><td> <em>Instructions: </em> <ol>
<li>Create a branch for this assignment called <em>M6-HTML5-Canvas</em></li>
<li>Pick a base HTML5 game from <a href="https://bencentra.com/2017-07-11-basic-html5-canvas-games.html">https://bencentra.com/2017-07-11-basic-html5-canvas-games.html</a></li>
<li>Create a folder inside public_html called  <em>M6</em></li>
<li>Create an html5.html file in your M6 folder (do not put it in Project even if you&#39;re doing arcade)</li>
<li>Copy one of the base games (from the above link)</li>
<li>Add/Commit the baseline of the game you&#39;ll mod for this assignment <em>(Do this before you start any mods/changes)</em></li>
<li>Make two significant changes<ol>
<li>Static changes like hard-coded colors/values will not count at all (i.e., changing shapes/colors/values that are globally defined and set only once.</li>
<li>Direct copies of my class example changes will not be accepted (i.e., just having an AI player for pong, rotating canvas, or multi-ball unless you make a significant tweak to it)</li>
<li>Significant changes are things that change with game logic or modify how the game works. Static changes like hard-coded colors/values will not count at all (i.e., changing shapes/colors/values that are globally defined and set only once). You may however change such values through game logic during runtime. (i.e., when points are scored, boundaries are hit, some action occurs, etc)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Evidence/Screenshots<ol>
<li>As best as you can, gather evidence for your first significant change and fill in the deliverable items below.</li>
<li>As best as you can, gather evidence for your significant change and fill in the deliverable items below.</li>
<li>Remember to include your ucid/date as comments in any screenshots that have code</li>
<li>Ensure your screenshots load and are visible from the md file in step 9</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In the M6 folder create a new file called m6_submission.md</li>
<li>Save your below responses, generate the markdown, and paste the output to this file</li>
<li>Add/commit/push all related files as necessary</li>
<li>Merge your pull request once you&#39;re satisfied with the .md file and the canvas game mods</li>
<li>Create a new pull request from dev to prod and merge it</li>
<li>Locally checkout dev and pull the merged changes from step 12</li>
</ol>
<p>Each missed or failed to follow instruction is eligible for -0.25 from the final grade</p>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The first change I made was to lower the speed from 25 to<br>5. What I also did was make it so the speed would decrease<br>by 1 every time when it collected the target. So if they collect<br>2 targets the speed would go down to 3. I made it say<br>in the directions that they have to score 6 to win. But with<br>this change they could never win. I used an if statement that ended<br>the game if the speed was less then or equal to 0 which<br>it would be after the user collects 5 targets<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The second change I made to the game was to make the user<br>smaller and smaller as they collected more targets. I decided to do this<br>because my game is not suppose to be beatable and this adds to<br>the annoying factor to it. I did this my changing the collide if<br>statement and added the statement to subtract by 5 each time the user<br>collects the target. they get smaller.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Talk about what you learned during this assignment and the related HTML5 Canvas readings (at least a few sentences for full credit)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I honestly learned a lot during this assignment. I learned that making a<br>game like this is not as complicated as I thought it would be.<br>And also how you also have to think out of the box. For<br>example, if you want to erase the target the easiest way is to<br>draw over it with the same color. This is just one example of<br>how you have to think when using HTML5 in a smart way. <br></p><br></td></tr>
